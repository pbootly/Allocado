# Allocado
Allacado is a simple custom memory allocator written in C. It simulates a memory pool and provides functionality for allocating and freeing memory blocks. It also features a visualization of the memory pool state to help understand how the allocator works internally.

# Building
`make test` - Simple allocate and free test
`make` - builds allocado binary, which simply iterates through a loop, randomly allocating or freeing memory from the pool
